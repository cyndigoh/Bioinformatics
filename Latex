\caption[1bcontrolconc]{For the ERCCs (a), there is a clear association observed between concentration and normalised read yield. For the plasmids (b), a similar trend is observed for p1990 and p2022. The anomaly observed with pHBV may have been due to inaccuraces in nucleic acid quantification and subsequent spike-ins. RPKM = reads per kilobase of fragment per million reads.}
